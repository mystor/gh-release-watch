Github Release Watch
====================

GitHub Release Watch (GHRW) makes sure that you always stay up-to-date on new releases of projects you love.  It does this by checking GitHub daily for new tags on your favourite repositories, and sends you an email if there are.

~~You can find GitHub Release Watch online at [http://gh-release-watch.com](http://gh-release-watch.com).~~

**GitHub Release Watch will no longer be avaliable as of March 25, 2016.**

## Running Locally

GitHub Release Watch is written with [Meteor](http://meteor.com). 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mystor/gh-release-watch.git
cd gh-release-watch
meteor
```

## FAQ

### How often does GHRW check for new tags?
GHRW checks every for new tags from the GitHub API every hour.

### How are the repository suggestions generated?
When you first sign up, your stars are retrieved from GitHub, and used for suggestions. They are currently not being updated when you change your stars on GitHub, though that may change in the future.

### Can I change my email once I sign up?
Yes, at the bottom of the page there is a (change) link to allow you to change your email.  Your email defaults to your public one on GitHub.

### How does unsubscribing work?
When you click the `unsubscribe` link in an email, your account is deactivated.  Deactivated accounts will not receive updates.  If you re-activate your account at a later date, by logging in and pressing the reactivate button, then you will continue to recieve email.

Occasionally I may delete old accounts which are deactivated.  If this happens you will have to reselect your watches if you return.
